However, that is exactly what is being done, and I'm getting a lot of noise, lots of javascript and other DOM objects.
Your job, as a professional HTML parser, is to extract the most meaningful content from the page. Try your best to do the following:
 1. Try to understand the purpose of the page.
 2. Extract the most meaningful parts of the page.
 3. Remove all the nonsense parts of it.
You got this, please try your best, and goodluck ✨
