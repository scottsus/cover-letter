export const elevenLabs = `Dear Hiring Manager at ElevenLabs,
I'm Alan ðŸ‘‹ and last year, I used ElevenLabs to build MAIT - Medical AI Translator - at the HackLA Hackathon. A multicomponent project involving training a small google/t5-flan model through Knowledge Distillation, a robust Python FastAPI backend, React/TypeScript frontend, efficient Huggingface Spaces GPU usage, and more, it was an amazing learning experience that also provided enough utility for doctors like Daniel T., MD to offer us mentorships, and additionally led us to win the Impact Award at the Hackathon. In particular, we used the 'elevenlabs' library to build the text to speech component. I used the 'eleven_multilingual_v2' model, and not only was it a powerful model that worked beautifully out of the box, it was also an amazing developer experience in setting it up.
A few days ago, I was thrilled to find out that ElevenLabs is hiring a Full-Stack Engineer, and I wanted to express my deepest interest in this position. Besides MAIT, here are a few other reasons why I believe I'm a great fit:
 1. Python expertise, as showcased in my open-source, multi-agent debugger, ðŸ”¥ flamethrower [https://github.com/scottsus/flamethrower], including various testing frameworks like PyTest and mypy.
 2. Substantial experience in full-stack web development using React/Next & TypeScript, as demonstrated at my startup Spotlight [https://www.producthunt.com/products/spotlight-8#spotlight-12] (React, Webpack) and my personal website [https://scottsus.dev] (Next).
 3. At AWS, my cloud infrastructure abilities coupled with strong understanding of systems was showcased through my project to preserve the MySQL Innodb buffer pool data to eliminate cache misses on metadata changes.
 4. At Sourcegraph, experience in Postgres led to redesigning the repo syncing method that improved syncing efficiency by 42%.
 5. Leadership role at USC LavaLab reflects my dedication to fostering a technically heavy & passionate team environment, aligning closely with ElevenLabs' value of mutual support and pursuit of excellence.
Most importantly, I'm most excited about joining ElevenLabs because it means being at the forefront of transforming the voice-over and speech synthesis industry through cutting edge AI and deep learning technologies. In particular, offering high-quality, linguistically accurate audio in a wide range of languages means better facilitation of effective conversation between different cultures, just like the English speaking medical professionals and the third-world patient problem as highlighted with MAIT. This opens up new possibilities for not just content creation but also democratizes access to technology to even those with limited resources, and nothing fires me up more than using technology for good. ðŸ™Œ

Warmest regards,

export const doorDash = `Dear Mrs. Hiring Manager,
I'm Nikola ðŸ‘‹ I saw your LinkedIn post and am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer I New Graduate position (Job ID: 2785113) at DoorDash. With a Master's degree on the horizon and a robust suite of technical experiences from internships, startups, and research projects, I am eager to bring my skills and passion to your esteemed engineering team. As someone deeply interested in on-demand logistics and its transformative potential in the marketplace, the role aligns perfectly with my career aspirations.
Here are some key reasons why I believe to be a great fit for the role at DoorDash:
 1. My internships at AWS and Sourcegraph provided ample experience with databases (SQL and Postgres) and systems engineering, where the prototypes I built have been successfully pushed to pre-production environments.
 2. At Sourcegraph in particular, I built a large-scale repo syncing mechanism involving async background jobs managed in Postgres and written in Go. Performance was key as syncing time directly impacts our clients' developer experience.
 3. In my previous final round interview with DoorDash for the 2023 Summer Software Engineering internship, I successfully implemented a Union-Find Disjoint Set (UFDS) algorithm to solve a particularly challenging problem
 4. Currently building ðŸ”¥ flamethrower [https://github.com/scottsus/flamethrower], an open-source, multi-agent shell with AI superpowers. Always lots of room for improvement, but am proud of how I structured my code to be modular & extensible, and easily tested & mocked with pytest.
 5. Wrote a number of ML papers including training a smaller student model with Knowledge Distillation for medical jargon simplification [https://github.com/scottsus/MedTranslate] in multiple spoken languages, training a CNN to classify trash based on images [https://github.com/scottsus/TrashCNN], and currently fine-tuning a base Orca 2 model to perform Chain-of-Thought reasoning for coding tasks.
 6. In 2023 I built Spotlight [https://www.producthunt.com/products/spotlight-8#spotlight-12], where I tackled the challenges of developing, releasing, and running a large-scale chrome extension with a backend FastAPI server with over 600 users.
I am particularly excited about the prospect of contributing to DoorDash's mission to empower local economies by making delivery intelligent and accessible. The opportunity to collaborate with a diverse set of bright minds in a culture that values innovation and resilience is particularly appealing to me. Thanks for your consideration ðŸ™Œ

Warmest regards,

export const rabbit = `Good morning Jesse and Rabbit.tech,
I'm John ðŸ‘‹ and I'm building ðŸ”¥ flamethrower, a multi-agent LM model that uses specialized agents to write, run, test, and iterate on code. It's amazing to see that, while I was pioneering the open source software version of LM agent-teams (I believe you called it LAM, the exact word I used in my project README as well), you guys were trailblazing the hardware side of it.
I can speak for days about the technical similarities between our products, but the one thing I really loved about Rabbit is the obsession with UI and customer satisfaction. Watching the Keynote was akin to watching Steve Jobs present the iPhone, or Tim Cook the Apple Vision Pro.
I would love to join forces and combine our various expertise on action models, and while I am the David to your Goliath, I'm optimistic that, with my adaptability and humility, I'll be able to offer meaningful insights and be a valuable member of your team over time.
Besides high-level OpenAI function calls, I also have experience with:
 1. Fine-tuning and prompt-engineering: [https://github.com/scottsus/MedTranslate]
 2. Writing large parallel applications: [https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/39292]
 3. Training CNN models for computer vision: [https://github.com/scottsus/TrashCNN]
Needless to say I was trained with fundamental web development skills with these and more:
 1. deep experience of Python, Node.TS, React/Next: [https://github.com/scottsus/Portfolio-v2]
 2. experience with AWS Aurora as an SDE Intern, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, EC2 as an end-user
I am currently based in Los Angeles, where I'm finishing up my Master's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning, and I can start as early as August of this year.
It would be nothing short of an honor to combine our knowledge and passion for LAMs to develop amazing products for our end-users ðŸ™Œ

Warmest regards,
John von Neumann
